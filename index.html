    <p>Hello! I'm software engineer who currently works on a high-loaded social
      media resource as a senior Scala developer in Moscow, Russia. This page is
      about me as a developer, the resources which I consider not that popular
      but still really helpful, and a little bit about my tooling.</p>

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>I really like to have a strong understanding of the whole picture (but
      with reasonable limits) about the subject especially when it comes down
      to computer-related field. That's why I'm interested in the quite low-level
      electoronics as well as the high-level programming and abstractions.
      Also as you can probably tell by looking at this page, I'd like to keep
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_terminology#KISS">things
      simple</a>.

    <p>Here should go my resume: but it's still under construction.</p>
